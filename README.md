## Description

Welcome to So-Flood, a website that allows users to search for flood risk in their area. Users can search by zip code or address and will be presented with a map of their area with flood risk zones highlighted.  Users can also view a list of resources for preparing for and recovering from floods. So-Flood is a valuable tool for anyone who wants to be informed about flood risk in their area and take steps to protect themselves and their property, and use it as a resource to present it to their insurance companies to lower their home owner's' insurance. 

## User Story
As a homeowner, I want to be able to search for flood risk in my area so that I can be informed about the risk and take steps to protect myself and my property. I also want to be able to view resources for preparing for and recovering from floods so that I can be prepared in case of an emergency. In addition, I want to be able to share this information with my insurance company to lower my homeowner's insurance.
